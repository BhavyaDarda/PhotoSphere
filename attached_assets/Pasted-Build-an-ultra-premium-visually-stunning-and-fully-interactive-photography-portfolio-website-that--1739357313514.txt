Build an ultra-premium, visually stunning, and fully interactive photography portfolio website that feels like a high-end art gallery. The website should:

1. Homepage (Hero Section):
Feature a fullscreen auto-playing video background or a high-resolution, animated hero slider showcasing your best shots.
Add a 3D parallax scrolling effect where images subtly move as the user scrolls or tilts their device.
Include an elegant tagline like "Discover the World Through My Lens" with smooth text fade-ins and a shimmering light effect.
Integrate an interactive "Explore Portfolio" button with a hover animation (e.g., a glowing border or ripple effect).
2. Gallery (Core Section):
Implement a dynamic, filterable gallery using categories like Travel, Nature, Portraits, etc.
Use infinite scrolling for a seamless browsing experience.
Include a lightbox viewer with cinematic transitions (e.g., zoom-in and fade) and smooth carousel navigation between images.
Add AI-powered auto-tagging for photo metadata to improve searchability within the site.
Allow users to download high-res wallpapers of selected photos for free or gated behind a sign-up CTA.
3. Interactive Features:
Add a before-and-after slider to showcase unedited vs. edited versions of your photos.
Include animated hotspots on images (e.g., reveal location, camera settings, or story) when users hover.
Integrate a 3D photo display (like flipping photo cards) for a luxurious browsing experience.
4. About Section:
Create a visually immersive "About Me" page with scroll-triggered animations (e.g., text fades, image zoom-ins).
Include a short video introduction of yourself with a typewriter-style animation for text overlays.
Add an interactive timeline of your photography journey, with smooth transitions and clickable highlights.
5. Interactive Portfolio Showroom:
Build an immersive gallery experience where users can "walk" through a virtual gallery of your photos (e.g., WebGL or Three.js for 3D environments).
Let users click on framed images to expand and learn more about the story behind the shot.
Add soundscapes (e.g., nature sounds, ambient music) to create an emotional connection to each category.
6. Client/Collaboration Section:
Showcase a "Brands Iâ€™ve Worked With" carousel, styled with luxury aesthetics (e.g., logos glowing on hover).
Add testimonials with an elegant, animated card slider.
Include a downloadable media kit button with hover effects (e.g., shine or color gradient shift).
7. Contact Page:
Add a modern, interactive contact form with smooth transitions (e.g., input fields expanding on click).
Integrate live chat functionality for quick inquiries (e.g., Crisp or Tidio).
Use map integration with animated location pins showing where your photos were taken.
8. Animations & Transitions:
Use Framer Motion or GSAP for professional-grade animations, including scroll-triggered animations and elegant hover effects.
Add subtle, premium cursor effects (e.g., a trailing glow or magnifier for images).
Incorporate page transition animations (e.g., smooth fade or slide transitions when navigating between pages).
9. Responsive Design:
Make the website fully responsive and optimized for all devices (mobile, tablet, desktop, 4K screens).
Include custom layouts for portrait and landscape modes on mobile devices.
10. Luxury Design Aesthetics:
Use neomorphism and glassmorphism for buttons and cards to give a futuristic, premium feel.
Opt for a dark theme with glowing accents (e.g., gold or teal highlights) for a cinematic look.
Add soft gradients, reflections, and shadows to UI elements.
Choose elegant typography (e.g., Playfair Display, Lora, or Montserrat) and pair it with refined, modern icons.
11. Performance Optimization:
Compress and optimize images for faster loading without losing quality.
Use lazy-loading and preloading for images and assets.
Ensure smooth performance with a Lighthouse score of 90+ for desktop and mobile.
12. SEO & Analytics:
Integrate advanced SEO features: dynamic meta tags, Open Graph data, and image alt text.
Add Google Analytics and heatmaps for tracking user behavior.
13. Tech Stack:
Use React.js for the front end and Tailwind CSS for styling.
Implement animations with Framer Motion or GSAP.
Use Firebase or Vercel for hosting and backend support.
Leverage Swiper.js for carousels and Three.js for 3D experiences.
